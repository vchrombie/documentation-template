# Install GrimoireLab

GrimoireLab offers three options for installation:

* [Docker Compose](./docker-compose)
  - Use `docker-compose` if you want separate containers for the database.
* [Docker](./docker)
  - Use `docker run` if you want to work with one self-contained container that includes everything.
* [PIP](./pip)
  - Use `pip` if you want to use GrimoireLab components individually.

Regardless of which way you install GrimoireLab, you will need to configure it as described below.
